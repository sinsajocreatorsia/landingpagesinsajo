        answer: "Zero learning curve. Our team configures everything in 48-72 hours. You just define what you want the agent to do and we take care of the rest. No code, no complications."
      },
      {
        question: "Does it sound robotic?",
        answer: "Not at all. We configure the tone, personality and style of your brand. Customers don't notice a difference - in fact, many prefer the speed and 24/7 availability of the AI agent."
      },
      {
        question: "What if the AI doesn't know how to respond?",
        answer: "We train it with your specific information. If it encounters something new it doesn't know, it notifies you immediately, escalates to a human if necessary, and learns for next time. Constantly improving."
      },
      {
        question: "How much does it really cost?",
        answer: "Fraction of employee cost. We're talking 70-80% less than hiring staff. Guaranteed positive ROI in less than 30 days. Think about what you save: salaries, benefits, training, turnover."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I try it before committing?",
        answer: "Of course! We offer a free 30-minute demo where you see it working with YOUR real business. We configure a test agent so you see exactly how it would work before making any decision."
      },
      {
        question: "Is it secure? What about my data?",
        answer: "Enterprise-level security. Advanced encryption, GDPR compliance, secure storage. Your data is never shared or used to train public models. Total control of your information."
      },
      {
        question: "Does it integrate with my current tools?",

      {
        question: "What if I want to cancel?",
